### Important Features of a Text Editor


**What are four important features to look!
 for in a text editor?**
1. **Syntax Highlighting:** A good text editor should provide syntax highlighting for various programming languages. This feature helps make your code more readable by color-coding different elements like keywords, strings, and comments.

2. **Autocompletion:** Autocompletion suggests code snippets, variable names, and function names as you type. It can save you time and reduce typos by completing code for you based on what you've typed so far.

3. **Version Control Integration:** Integration with version control systems like Git is crucial for tracking changes in your code. It allows you to commit, push, pull, and manage branches directly from the editor.

4. **Extensibility:** The ability to extend the functionality of the text editor through plugins or extensions is valuable. You can tailor the editor to your specific needs by adding features or customizing existing ones.

### Command Explanations
**What do the following commands do?**
- `pwd`: This command stands for "Print Working Directory." It displays the current directory (folder) you are in.

- `ls`: This command is used to list the contents of the current directory. It shows the files and subdirectories in the current directory.

- `cd`: This command stands for "Change Directory." It is used to navigate to a different directory. You can provide the directory path as an argument to change to that directory.

- `mkdir`: This command is used to create a new directory (folder).

- `touch`: This command is used to create an empty file. If the file already exists, it updates the file's access and modification timestamps.

**Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line?** 
cd projects: This command changes the current directory to "projects."

- 'mkdir new-project: This command creates a new directory called "new-project" inside the "projects" directory.

- touch new-project/newfile.md: This command creates a new empty file named "newfile.md" inside the "new-project" directory.

- cd ..: This command moves up one level in the directory hierarchy, so you are back in the "projects" directory.

- ls projects/new-project: This command lists the contents of the "new-project" directory, showing any files or subdirectories within it.
