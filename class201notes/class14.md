# CSS Transformations and Transitions Q&A

## CSS Transforms

### 1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

A CSS transform allows developers to manipulate the presentation of HTML elements in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. It enables operations like translation, rotation, scaling, and skewing without affecting the document flow.

### 2. Can you provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website?

```css
.card {
  transition: transform 0.5s;
}

.card:hover {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
}
```

## CSS Transitions & Animations

### What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

A CSS transition allows developers to smoothly change property values over a specified duration. This creates a polished and visually appealing transition between different states of an element.

### How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

While both animations and transitions alter CSS properties over time, animations are more versatile. They allow for intricate keyframe-based movements, offering greater complexity and control. Transitions, on the other hand, are simpler and ideal for basic state changes.

### What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?

- **Improved User Experience:** Smooth transitions enhance user interaction.
- **Enhanced Visual Appeal:** Transitions add sophistication to a website's design.
- **Attention to Detail:** They allow developers to focus on subtle details, making the site stand out.
