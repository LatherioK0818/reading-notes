# HTML and CSS Basics

## Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

Semantic HTML elements provide meaning to the structure of a web page. They help both humans and search engines understand the content better. This is crucial for accessibility and SEO.

## How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (the highest level) to `<h6>` (the lowest level).

## What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?

The `<sup>` element is used to denote superscript text, often for things like exponents. The `<sub>` element is used for subscript text, like chemical formulas.

## When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

To provide the full expansion of an abbreviation using the `<abbr>` element, you should use the `title` attribute. For example: `<abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>`.

## How can we apply CSS to our HTML?

You can apply CSS to HTML using external stylesheets, internal styles within the `<style>` element, or inline styles on individual HTML elements.

## Why should we avoid using inline styles?

Inline styles can make your HTML less maintainable and harder to update. It's generally better to separate the presentation (CSS) from the structure (HTML) for better organization and reusability.

## Review of the CSS code block:

- The selector is represented by `h2`.
- The CSS declarations are `color: black` and `padding: 5px`.
- The components considered properties are `color` and `padding`.

# JavaScript Basics

## What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?

A sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks is considered a string data type in JavaScript.

## List 4 types of JavaScript operators.

Four types of JavaScript operators are arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and assignment operators.

## Describe a real-world problem you could solve with a function.

You could create a function to calculate and display the total cost of items in a shopping cart, which takes item prices and quantities as input and returns the total cost.

## An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.

An if statement checks a condition, and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.

## What is the use of an else if?

An "else if" statement is used when you want to check multiple conditions in sequence. It provides an alternative condition to check if the previous "if" condition is false.

## List 3 different types of comparison operators.

Three different types of comparison operators are `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), and `>` (greater than).

## What is the difference between the logical operator `&&` and `||`?

The `&&` (logical AND) operator returns true if both of its operands are true. The `||` (logical OR) operator returns true if at least one of its operands is true.
