### What is a real-world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

The `alt` attribute is used in HTML to provide alternative text for images. Its real-world use case is for web accessibility. It ensures that users with disabilities or those who have images turned off in their browsers can still understand the content of the image.

### How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

To improve image accessibility, you should:

- Use the `alt` attribute to provide descriptive text.
- Ensure images are relevant to the content.
- Use semantic HTML, such as `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for complex images.
- Consider color contrast and provide text alternatives for images with text content.

### Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document

The `<figure>` element is useful for grouping images, diagrams, charts, or other media with a related caption using the `<figcaption>` element. For instance, if you have an article and want to display a chart with a caption, you can use `<figure>` to wrap both the chart and its description.

### Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community

GIF images are like old-fashioned animated pictures. They're a series of frames, like a flipbook, and they can have simple animations. SVG images, on the other hand, are like instructions for drawing. They're like blueprints that tell the computer how to make an image. SVGs can be simple or very detailed, and they scale nicely without losing quality.

### What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

For screenshots, it's often best to use PNG (Portable Network Graphics) or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) images. PNG is great for screenshots with text or sharp details, as it supports transparency. JPEG is suitable for screenshots with lots of colors or gradients but doesn't support transparency. The choice depends on the specific content and whether transparency is needed.

To add character to a colorless website, you can:

- Choose a color scheme that reflects the website's purpose.
- Add color to headings, links, and buttons for emphasis.
- Use background colors or images to make sections stand out.
- Ensure text and background colors have good contrast for readability.

### What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

When choosing fonts, consider:

- Readability: Ensure the font is easy to read.
- Compatibility: Use web-safe fonts or provide fallback options.
- Branding: Select fonts that match the website's tone and purpose.
- Consistency: Use a limited number of fonts for a cohesive design.

### What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

- `font-size` controls the text's size, making it larger or smaller.
- `font-weight` adjusts the thickness or boldness of the text.
- `font-style` changes the text's style, making it italic or normal.
