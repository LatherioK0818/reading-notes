# Questions and Answers

## Objects

[Javascript Objects Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)

### How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

- **Answer:** Objects are like containers with labels that help organize and access information. For example, think of a box labeled "dog" with details like its name, age, and color inside.

### What are some advantages to creating object literals?

- **Answer:** Object literals are easy to create, organize related data, can hold various types of information, and allow access using dot or bracket notation.

### How do objects differ from arrays?

- **Answer:** Objects use named labels (properties) to organize data, while arrays use numbered indexes. Objects represent entities with diverse properties, whereas arrays are used for lists of similar items.

### Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

- **Answer:** You would use bracket notation when the property name is dynamic or not a valid identifier. For example, `dog['age']` if the property name is in a variable.

### Evaluate the code below. What does the term 'this' refer to, and what is the advantage of using 'this'?

- **Answer:** In the provided code, 'this' refers to the current object, 'dog.' The advantage of using 'this' is dynamic access to object properties. It's used in the `humanAge` function to calculate the dog's human age based on its 'name' and 'age' properties.

## The DOM (Document Object Model)

[Introdcution to DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
### What is the DOM?

- **Answer:** The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface provided by browsers. It represents web pages as a tree-like structure of objects, allowing developers to manipulate and interact with web content using languages like JavaScript.

### Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

- **Answer:** JavaScript and the DOM are closely related. JavaScript can access and modify the DOM, making web pages interactive. The DOM serves as a bridge, enabling JavaScript to manipulate web content, change text, add or remove elements, and respond to user interactions, making web development dynamic and responsive.
