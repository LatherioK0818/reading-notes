### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

- Flexbox is designed to handle one-dimensional layouts, allowing you to arrange content along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically. This simplifies the process of distributing and aligning items within a container.

### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

- In Flexbox, there are two important concepts: the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is the primary axis along which items are arranged, either horizontally or vertically. The cross axis is the axis perpendicular to the main axis, and it affects how items are positioned relative to the main axis.

### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

- While Flexbox is a powerful layout tool, using it improperly can negatively impact accessibility. For instance, relying solely on Flexbox for layout can lead to a lack of semantic structure in the HTML, making it difficult for screen readers and assistive technologies to interpret the content correctly.
