# Reading Notes: Troubleshooting JavaScript and Debugging

## Key Differences between Syntax Error and Logic Error

1. **Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error:**

   - **Syntax Error:**
     - Related to the code's structure and grammar.
     - Detected by the interpreter or compiler during compilation.
     - Examples: Typos, missing symbols, incorrect language element usage.

   - **Logic Error:**
     - Related to the flow and logic of the program.
     - Does not produce error messages but leads to incorrect behavior.
     - Examples: Flawed algorithms, incorrect variable manipulation.

## Types of Errors in Past Lab Assignments

2. **List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them:**

   - **Null Pointer Errors:**
     - Occurred when accessing uninitialized or non-existent objects/variables.
     - Resolution: Checked for null values and ensured proper initialization.

   - **Infinite Loops:**
     - Code got stuck in infinite loops.
     - Resolution: Identified loop conditions and modified them to exit correctly.

   - **Type Mismatch Errors:**
     - Occurred when using variables or data types incorrectly.
     - Resolution: Reviewed and adjusted variable types or conversions.

## Influence on Long-term Goals

3. **How will this topic continue to influence your long-term goals?**

   Understanding and mastering JavaScript, including troubleshooting errors, is vital for long-term goals in software development. It is essential for creating reliable and user-friendly web applications.

## The JavaScript Debugger

4. **How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

   The JavaScript Debugger is a valuable tool for software developers. It allows you to:

   - Set breakpoints in your code for pausing execution.
   - Inspect variable values, the call stack, and the program's current state.
   - Step through the code line by line to identify logic errors.
   - Analyze the real-time execution of your code.

5. **Define what a breakpoint is:**

   A breakpoint is a designated point in your code where execution pauses. It helps inspect the program's state, including variables, expressions, and the call stack.

6. **What is the call stack?**

   The call stack keeps track of function calls in your code, representing the order in which functions are called. Understanding the call stack is crucial for debugging and comprehending program control flow.

## Debugging HTML and CSS

Debugging HTML and CSS is essential for web development. Debugging tools in web browsers, like DevTools, help identify and fix layout and styling issues.

This topic matters as debugging is integral to software development. Understanding error types and debugging tools can significantly improve efficiency in identifying and resolving code issues.
