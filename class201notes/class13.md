# Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

## Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

Local storage is often used in web development for the following reasons:

- **Persistent Data:** Local storage allows data to be stored on the user's device, persisting across browser sessions. This is useful for saving user preferences, settings, or other data that should remain accessible even after the user closes the browser.
- **Reduced Server Load:** Storing data on the client side can reduce the need to make frequent requests to the server for the same data, which can improve performance.
- **Offline Functionality:** Local storage can be used to enable certain features even when the user is offline by storing relevant data locally.

## What information should not be stored in local storage?

While local storage is handy, it's important to be cautious about what you store in it. You should avoid storing sensitive or confidential data, such as:

- **User Credentials:** Never store usernames, passwords, or access tokens in local storage as it could be a security risk.
- **Sensitive Personal Information:** Avoid storing personal information like social security numbers, credit card details, or anything that could be exploited if accessed by unauthorized parties.
- **Large Amounts of Data:** Local storage has limited storage capacity (usually around 5-10 MB), so don't store large files or excessive data.

## Local storage can store what type of data? How to convert it to that type before storing?

Local storage primarily stores data in the form of strings. To store other data types, such as objects or numbers, you need to convert them to strings. This can be done using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Here's a simple example in JavaScript:

```javascript
// To store an object in local storage
const dataObject = { key: 'value', number: 42 };
localStorage.setItem('myData', JSON.stringify(dataObject));

// To retrieve and convert it back to an object
const storedData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('myData'));
