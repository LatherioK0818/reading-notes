# Class 1 Reading notes

**1.) Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers:**

- `To go on the adventure of HTTP,
One must first speak with the client before your leave,
It requests from the server you see must agree,
Then you will feast your eyes upon what you see.`

**2.) Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.**

Parsing is when the data is turned or painted into a page on the screen. The DOM or Document Object model is the representation of the markup. It is an API that interacts with HTML.
DOM allows the code to access and interact with every node on the document.  The Browser parses the HTML and recognizes the link element references to CSS stylesheets and any scipt elements. As the browser parses the HTML, it sends any request to the server for CSS files found in the link elements. It does the same for any Javascript files found as well.
