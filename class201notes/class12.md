**What is the importance of the closing &lt;/canvas&gt; tag?**

- The closing &lt;/canvas&gt; tag is important because it defines the end of the &lt;canvas&gt; element, and everything you draw or manipulate within the &lt;canvas&gt; element should be enclosed between the opening &lt;canvas&gt; and closing &lt;/canvas&gt; tags.

**Explain what the getContext() method does.**

- The getContext() method is used to obtain the rendering context of the &lt;canvas&gt; element, which allows you to draw on the canvas. It takes a parameter specifying the context type, like '2d' for 2D rendering. For example, you can use getContext('2d') to get a 2D rendering context, and then you can draw on the canvas using various drawing methods and functions.
