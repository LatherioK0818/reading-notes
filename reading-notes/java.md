**What are variables in JavaScript?**

 Variables are data containers that provide systems with data or a specific set of information. variables are used to store and manage data. They act as containers for values. There are four types of variables.

They are :

 `let` : allows you to declare block-scoped variables.

 `const`: allows you to declare block-scoped variables. It's commonly used in modern JavaScript.

 `var`: This was the original way to declare variables in JavaScript, but it has some scoping issues and is now considered outdated. It's function-scoped.

 `primitive data`: The primitive data types include Numbers,String,boolean, and null.

-*Numbers*: numbers are used to represent numeric values. These can be integers (whole numbers) or floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals). For example, 5 and 3.14 are both examples of numbers.

-*Strings*: sequences of characters, like letters, numbers, and symbols, enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or backticks (`) quotes. They are used to represent text. For instance, "Hello, World!" is a string.
-*Boolean*: one of two values: true or false. They are often used for making decisions in code. For example, you might use a boolean to check if something is true or false, like isTodaySunny = true.

-*Null*:the intentional absence of any object or value. It's often used to indicate that a variable or object has no value or hasn't been assigned a value yet. For instance, if a variable result is set to null, it means it currently has no meaningful value.

**What does it mean to declare a variable?**
When you declare a variable you are using a statement to specify the variable name and its type. This tells the compiler about it's existence and where it is located.

**What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?**
An assignment operator is an expression that assigns a value to the variable. Some examples may include, but are not limited to `=`, `+=`,`-=`,`*=`

**What is information received from the user called?**
