## Classes and Objects

- **Key Differences**: In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object of the class. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It's a concrete occurrence of the class with actual values, distinct from other instances.
- **Usage**: Classes are used to create and manage objects. When you instantiate a class, you create a new object of that type. This object can then be manipulated and its attributes modified.

### Thinking Recursively

- **Concept of Recursion**: Recursion in Python is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. It involves a function calling itself.
- **Example**: A classic example is calculating the factorial of a number: `factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)`. Base case: `factorial(1) = 1`.
- **Best Practices**: When implementing recursive functions, it's important to define a clear base case to prevent infinite loops. Ensure that each recursive step brings you closer to this base case. Also, be aware of Python's recursion limit and the potential for stack overflow in deep recursions.

#### Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

- **Purpose**: Pytest fixtures are used for setting up the pre-conditions needed for tests. Code coverage, on the other hand, measures how much of your code is being tested. It's a metric used to gauge the effectiveness of tests.
- **Usage Together**: By combining pytest fixtures with coverage analysis, you can ensure that your testing is thorough and covers a wide range of scenarios. Fixtures help to streamline and standardize test setups, while coverage metrics help identify untested parts of your code.

### Reading Questions

#### Classes and Objects in Python

- **Answer**: Classes are templates for creating objects, while objects are instances of classes with actual data. They work together in object-oriented programming to encapsulate data and behavior.

#### Recursion in Python

- **Answer**: Recursion is a method of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems of the same type. An example is a recursive function to calculate factorial. Best practices include defining a clear base case and ensuring no infinite loops.

#### Pytest Fixtures and Code Coverage

- **Answer**: Pytest fixtures are used for efficient test setup and teardown, while code coverage measures the extent to which the code is executed during testing. Used together, they enhance test quality and code maintainability by ensuring comprehensive testing and identifying untested code areas.
