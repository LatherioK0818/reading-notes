### Django Rest Framework (DRF) Permissions:
Django Rest Framework permissions are a crucial part of securing an API built with DRF. They provide a way to control access to different parts of the API based on the user's credentials and permissions. The key components of DRF permissions include:

1. **Permission Classes**: These are classes that determine if a user has permission to perform a certain action on a particular resource. DRF provides several built-in permission classes such as `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`, `AllowAny`, etc. These classes can be used individually or combined to create custom permission logic.

2. **Permission Policies**: Permission policies define how permissions are applied to different views or resources within the API. They can be set globally for the entire API or at a more granular level for specific views or viewsets.

3. **Permission Checks**: DRF performs permission checks before allowing a user to perform actions like creating, reading, updating, or deleting resources. These checks are usually done inside the views or viewsets using the `permission_classes` attribute.

The purpose of DRF permissions is to enforce security measures such as authentication, authorization, and access control to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions within the API. By defining and applying permission classes and policies, developers can control who can access what resources and what actions they can perform, thus enhancing the security of the API.

### SQL SELECT Statement:
In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database. Its purpose is to query the database and return a result set that matches the specified criteria. To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', you would use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

This query selects all columns (`*` denotes all columns) from the 'employees' table, returning all rows of data stored in that table.

### DRF Generic Views:
DRF Generic Views are pre-built views provided by Django Rest Framework that help in simplifying the process of building RESTful APIs by reducing the amount of code developers need to write. These views are designed to perform common actions such as retrieving a list of objects, retrieving a single object by its primary key, creating a new object, updating an existing object, or deleting an object.

Some examples of DRF Generic Views include:

1. **ListAPIView**: This view is used to retrieve a list of objects from a queryset and return them as a serialized response.

2. **RetrieveAPIView**: It retrieves a single object by its primary key and returns it as a serialized response.

3. **CreateAPIView**: This view is used to create a new object instance.

4. **UpdateAPIView**: It updates an existing object instance.

5. **DestroyAPIView**: This view deletes an object instance.

By using DRF Generic Views, developers can quickly create APIs for their Django applications with minimal code, as these views handle common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations out of the box. Developers can customize the behavior of these views by extending them and overriding methods as needed.
