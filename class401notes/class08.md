Creating a cheat sheet for understanding the concepts of stacks and queues can be an effective way to grasp these fundamental data structures. Let's organize this cheat sheet using the WHY, WHAT, HOW structure and include a few analogies and examples for clearer understanding.

### Cheat Sheet for Stacks and Queues

#### Stacks

**1. WHY:** 
   - Stacks are used because they provide an orderly way of handling a collection of elements, especially when the order of operations is important. 
   - Common use cases: Undo mechanisms in software, parsing expressions in compilers, and managing function calls (call stack).

**2. WHAT:** 
   - A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 
   - The last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

**3. HOW:** 
   - **Operations:**
     - **Push:** Add an element to the top of the stack.
     - **Pop:** Remove and return the top element from the stack.
     - **Peek:** Return the top element without removing it.
     - **IsEmpty:** Check if the stack is empty.

   - **Analogy:** Think of a stack of plates. You can only add (push) or remove (pop) plates from the top of the stack.

#### Queues

**1. WHY:** 
   - Queues are used where we need to manage objects in a sequence where the first one in, is the first one out (FIFO).
   - Common uses: Order processing, breadth-first search in graphs, and buffering in data communication.

**2. WHAT:** 
   - A queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. 
   - The order is First In, First Out (FIFO).

**3. HOW:** 
   - **Operations:**
     - **Enqueue:** Add an element to the end of the queue.
     - **Dequeue:** Remove and return the front element from the queue.
     - **Front:** Return the front element without removing it.
     - **IsEmpty:** Check if the queue is empty.

   - **Analogy:** Think of a queue in a grocery store. The first person in the line is the first one to be served.

#### Key Differences Between Stacks and Queues

- **Order:** Stacks are LIFO, Queues are FIFO.
- **Purpose:** Stacks are used for operations where the most recent data is required first, while Queues are used for operations where data is processed in the order it arrives.

#### Example: Implementing a Stack and Queue

- **Stack Example:** 
  ```python
  class Stack:
      def __init__(self):
          self.stack = []

      def push(self, item):
          self.stack.append(item)

      def pop(self):
          return self.stack.pop() if not self.is_empty() else None

      def peek(self):
          return self.stack[-1] if not self.is_empty() else None

      def is_empty(self):
          return len(self.stack) == 0
  ```

- **Queue Example:** 
  ```python
  class Queue:
      def __init__(self):
          self.queue = []

      def enqueue(self, item):
          self.queue.append(item)

      def dequeue(self):
          return self.queue.pop(0) if not self.is_empty() else None

      def front(self):
          return self.queue[0] if not self.is_empty() else None

      def is_empty(self):
          return len(self.queue) == 0
  ```
