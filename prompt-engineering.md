# Prompt Engineering

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering involves creating well-crafted prompts for artificial intelligence models, chatbots, or search engines. The goal is to produce clear, concise, and effective input that generates the desired output.

## Tips for Effective Prompt Engineering

### 1. **Be Clear and Specific**

- State your request or query clearly. Ambiguity can lead to unexpected results.

### 2. **Consider Context**

- Think about the context in which your prompt will be used. What information does the AI need to know?

### 3. **Start Simple**

- Begin with a straightforward prompt and iterate as needed. Overly complex prompts can be less effective.

### 4. **Use Keywords**

- Include relevant keywords to help the AI understand your intent.

### 5. **Test and Refine**

- Don't be afraid to experiment. Test different prompts and adjust based on results.

### 6. **Provide Examples**

- If appropriate, provide sample inputs or expected outputs to guide the AI.

### 7. **Understand Model Limitations**

- Different AI models have different capabilities. Know what the model you're working with can and can't do.

### 8. **Use OpenAI's Documentation**

- If you're working with GPT-3.5, refer to OpenAI's documentation for prompting best practices.

### 9. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**

- For creative tasks, use open-ended questions to encourage more imaginative responses.

## Example Prompt Engineering

 **How do you make a ragout sauce?**

**Teach me a new scale on the guitar.**

New Guitar Scale:
Let's learn the Dorian scale, which is a minor scale with a unique character:

Root: Start on any note, for example,

D. Whole and Half Steps: The pattern for a Dorian scale is Whole, Half, Whole, Whole, Whole, Half, Whole.

D Dorian Scale (with notes):

- D (Root)
- E
- F
- G
- A
- B
- C
- D (Octave)

Practice this scale by playing it up and down, and you'll have a new musical tool to use in your guitar playing.

**Teach me how to change the oil in my car.**
