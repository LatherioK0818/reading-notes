# Markdown Basics

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used for formatting plain text documents. It uses simple and easy-to-read syntax to add formatting elements to text.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text documents using a simple and readable syntax. It was created to make it easy to write and format text for the web.

## Why do we use Markdown?

Markdown is used because it provides a straightforward way to format text for various purposes, such as creating web content, documentation, and README files. It's human-readable, doesn't require specialized software, and can be converted into HTML or other formats.

## Heading Creation

In Markdown, you can create headings using the pound sign (hash symbol) `#`. The number of `#` symbols determines the heading level.

### How many do you need to create the largest heading?

To create the largest heading in Markdown, you need to use a single `#` symbol followed by a space before your heading text.

### How many do you need to create the smallest heading?

The smallest heading in Markdown is typically created using six `#` symbols followed by a space before your heading text.

## Emphasis

When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use the following symbols:

- To make text bold, you can enclose it in double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__`.
- To italicize text, you can enclose it in single asterisks `*` or single underscores `_`.

## Creating Links

To create a link in Markdown, you can use square brackets `[]` to enclose the link text and parentheses `()` to enclose the URL. 
## Creating Lists

You can create an unordered (bulleted) list in Markdown using one of the following symbols: `*`, `-`, or `+`. For example:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
