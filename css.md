# CSS Tips

**What is the purpose of CSS?**

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and formatting of web documents written in HTML and XML. The primary purpose of CSS is to control the layout, appearance, and styling of web pages.

**What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?**
Inline CSS: You can add CSS directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.

Internal (Embedded) CSS: You can include CSS rules within the style element in the HTML document's head section.

External (Embedded) CSS: You can include CSS rules within the style element in the HTML document's head section.

**Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all p elements red text.**

"
- < head>
- < style>
- p {
- color: red;
- }
-< /style>
-< /head>

"
