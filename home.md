## Introduction

I'm Latherio Kidd, an Air Force veteran with a comprehensive background in Information Technology, including IT Support,
data analytics, help desk operations, and cybersecurity. I'm originally from Louisiana. I am one of the few people to have wrestled an alligator and lived to tell my tale. This is my reading notes page, where I explore various topics of my journey to become a coding master and share my thoughts. Also, Go Saints!!
