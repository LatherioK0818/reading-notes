# Operators and Loops

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

An expression is a valid unit of code that resolve to a value. It can either assign a value or evaluate.

### Why would we use a loop in our code?
The loops help one shorten what typically take hundreds of code to  just a few lines. It allows one to write code once and repeat it as many times as needed.
#### When does a for loop stop executing?

It stops executing when the condition placed is no longer true or the value equal false. When the condition becomes false, the loop terminates, and the program continues with the code after the loop.

##### How many times will a while loop execute?

The number of times a while loop will execute depends on the condition specified in the while statement. The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition evaluates to true. If the condition is initially false, the loop won't execute at all. Therefore, the number of iterations for a while loop can vary, and it's based on when the condition becomes false.
