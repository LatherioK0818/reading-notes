# React and Forms Reading

## [How to use Forms in React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-form/)

This resource covers the basics of handling forms in React, including topics such as controlled components and event handling.

## What is a 'Controlled Component'?

Understanding controlled components is crucial in React. These are elements whose value is controlled by the React state, ensuring a seamless integration of user input into the application state. This concept is fundamental for effective form handling.

## State Update Strategy

The question of whether to wait and store the user's responses from the form into state upon submission or update the state as soon as they enter them is intriguing. Personally, I find that updating the state in real-time provides a more dynamic user experience. It offers instant feedback and responsiveness, enhancing the overall interaction. However, the decision ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the application.

## Event Handling

When dealing with an event handler on an input field, understanding how to target what the user is entering is crucial. The event handler in React conveniently provides an event object, allowing me to access the entered value using event.target.value.

### Why use a ternary operator?

Exploring the use of a ternary operator has been enlightening. Ternary operators offer a concise way of expressing conditional statements in JavaScript, making the code more readable. I appreciate their simplicity, especially for straightforward conditions.

### Exercise

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

console.log(x === y ? true : false);
