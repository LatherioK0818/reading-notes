### Reading: Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

#### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The decline of women in computer science occurred simultaneously with the rise of personal computers in homes. As computers became more common in households, marketing strategies and societal stereotypes contributed to the perception that computing was a male-oriented activity.

#### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
