# CRUD ReadMe

## Reading: CRUD Basics

### Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

To update a record through an API, you would typically use the HTTP method **PUT** or **PATCH**.

#### Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

REST methods such as **GET**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, and **DELETE** often require an ID parameter to identify the specific resource being manipulated.

#### Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

The relationship between REST and CRUD lies in their alignment of operations on resources. RESTful APIs implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through HTTP methods, providing a standardized and scalable approach to web service development.

#### If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. **Define Resources:** Identify and define the resources that your API will manage.
2. **Choose HTTP Methods:** Assign appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to CRUD operations for each resource.
3. **Design Endpoints:** Establish clear and intuitive endpoint URLs for each resource and operation.
4. **Implement CRUD Functions:** Write the server-side logic to handle CRUD operations for each resource.
5. **Test and Document:** Thoroughly test the API endpoints and document their functionality, including any additional features or considerations.

## Why This Matters

Understanding CRUD operations and their implementation in RESTful APIs is fundamental to web development. It enables developers to create scalable, efficient, and standardized interfaces for interacting with data.
