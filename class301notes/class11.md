# SQL vs NoSQL

## Differences between SQL and NoSQL

| Feature             | SQL                  | NoSQL                |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Data Model**      | Structured           | Flexible (Schema-less)|
| **Scalability**     | Vertical (Scale-up)  | Horizontal (Scale-out)|
| **Schema**          | Fixed Schema         | Dynamic Schema       |
| **Query Language**  | SQL (Structured Query Language)| No Standard Query Language|
| **Examples**        | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle | MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are suitable for structured data with well-defined schemas. Real-world examples include financial data, customer information, and transaction records.

## What kind of data is a good fit for a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases are suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples include social media data, user-generated content, and IoT data.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL databases are often better for hierarchical data storage due to their flexible schema and document-oriented nature.

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL databases are generally more scalable, especially when it comes to horizontal scalability, making them suitable for applications with growing data and user loads.

## SQL Questions

- **What does SQL stand for?**
  SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

- **What is a relational database?**
  A relational database is a type of database that uses a structure that allows the definition of data types, data integrity, and relationships among tables.

- **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**
  It works with a tabular structure, where data is organized in rows and columns.

- **What is a ‘schema’?**
  A schema is a blueprint that defines the structure of the database, including tables, fields, and relationships.

## NoSQL Questions

- **What is a NoSQL database?**
  NoSQL databases are a type of database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in a way other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

- **How does it work?**
  NoSQL databases work with a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, wide-column stores, and graph databases, providing flexibility in data representation.

- **What is inside of a MongoDB database?**
  MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

- **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**
  MongoDB is more flexible due to its schema-less nature, allowing for dynamic changes in data structure.

- **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**
  The lack of a standardized query language and potential for less strict consistency can be considered disadvantages of NoSQL databases.
