# React Lifecycle and State Vs Props

## React Lifecycle:

1. **Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?**
   - The 'render' method is called before the 'componentDidMount'.

2. **What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?**
   - The very first thing is the 'constructor' method.

3. **Put the following things in the order that they happen:**
   - `constructor`, `render`, `componentDidMount`, `React Updates`, `componentWillUnmount`.

4. **What does componentDidMount do?**
   - `componentDidMount` is called after the component has been rendered in the DOM. It's commonly used for operations like data fetching.

## React State Vs Props:

1. **What types of things can you pass in the props?**
   - Props are things that you can pass into a React component. They are similar to function arguments.

2. **What is the big difference between props and state?**
   - The big difference is that props are passed into a component, while state is managed within the component.

3. **When do we re-render our application?**
   - Re-rendering occurs when there is a change in either props or state.

4. **What are some examples of things that we could store in state?**
   - Examples include form input values, UI state (e.g., whether a modal is open), etc.

## Things I want to know more about

How the React ties into what we will be doing in the future ? How often is it used depending on where we land job placement and  also how much of react is used in the device we used on a daily basis ?
